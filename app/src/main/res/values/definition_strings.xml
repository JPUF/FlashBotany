    <string name="petal">Modified leaves that are usually conspicuously coloured. Collectively, the petals of a flower are known as the corolla.</string>
    <string name="sepal">Typically green or inconspicuous found on the outermost part of the flower. They provide protection for the flower. The flower buds seen before bloom are made of sepals. Collectively, the sepals of a flower are known as the calyx.</string>
    <string name="umbel">A type of inflorescence where a number of short stalks (pedicels) emerge from one point, like the spokes of an umbrella. A compound umbel is where there\'s an umbel at the end of each stalk</string>
    <string name="stigma">The top-most part of the female reproductive organ of a flower. The stigma receives pollen. The stigma is on top of the style, which is above the ovary. Collectively, these female parts form the pistil. </string>
    <string name="style">As part of the female reproductive organ of a flower, the style is a narrow tube-like extension connecting the ovary to the stigma.</string>
    <string name="ovary">Part of the female reproductive organ. The ovary holds ovules, and is where pollen grains fertilise ovules. An ovary is superior if it\'s situated above other flower parts (namely the petals/sepals/male parts). If it\'s beneath, then it\'s inferior.</string>
    <string name="pistil">The complete female reproductive organ of a flower. Made up of the ovary, style, and stigma. </string>
    <string name="stamen">The male reproductive organ, consisting of the filament, and anther. The androecium.</string>
    <string name="anther">The pollen-bearing part of the male reproductive organ (stamen).</string>
    <string name="whorl">Arranged to radiate from a single point, and wrap around the stem. Verticil.</string>
    <string name="inflorescence">A cluster of flowers on a branch or system of branches. There are many different forms of inflorescence, including: cyme, raceme, catkin, capitulum, and umbel.</string>
    <string name="serrated">Saw-toothed leaf margins.</string>
    <string name="stipule">A leafy outgrowth either side of the base of the leafstalk (petiole). If a stipule goes all the way around a stem, it\'s known as an ochrea (as in the genus Polygonum).</string>
    <string name="monocot">One of the two major groups of flowering plants, monocots have one cotyledon. The cotyledon is the \'embryonic leaf\', the first to appear after the seed germinates. All other flowering plants have two cotyledons (dicots).</string>
    <string name="cyme">A form of inflorescence.</string><!--TODO image inset in dialog to show this. -->
    <string name="floret">A particularly small/reduced flower, usually one of many in a tightly packed inflorescence, such as the capitulum of Asteraceae blooms.</string>
    <string name="bract">A small leaf/scale-like part placed at the base of a flower or inflorescence.</string>
    <string name="verticillaster">A \'false whorl\'. A compound inflorescence where a pair of (nearly sessile) cymes are arranged around an axis like a whorl (verticil).</string>
    <string name="fascicle">A bundle of leaves or flowers growing in a cluster together.</string>
